# classification-challengeRework
### Utilized Claude AI and the in-class solutions to assist with the coding framework. I have several questions about why the outputs are slightly different than the original ones noted (for the ipynb file). Does this pertain to the random_state function generated to display the arrays noted? Is it similar to how the head of the X_train data was displayed after the split? Clarification and explanation of this challenge would greatly be appreciated.
